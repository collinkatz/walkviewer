# Description
This project seeks to provide a robust and lightweight viewer for transit routes, sidewalks, and other non-auto-centric infrastructure. This would allow users to plan their transit routes and explore transit options in a way that highlights stops and pedestrian friendly options. This project builds off of experience I gained with a previous project, <a href="https://github.com/collinkatz/sidewalkhelper/">sidewalkhelper</a>.
